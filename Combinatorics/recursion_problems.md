### Problems

1) Given k, find the geometric sum i.e.
1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/(2^k)
using recursion. Return the answer.
Sample Input :
3
Sample Output :
1.875

### Problems

2) Check if a given String S is palindrome or not (using recursion). Return true or false.
Input Format :
String S
Output Format :
true or false
Sample Input 1 :
racecar
Sample Output 1:
true
Sample Input 2 :
ninja
Sample Output 2:
false

### Problems

3) Write a recursive function that returns the sum of the digits of a given integer.
Sample Input :
12345
Sample Output :
15

### Problems

4) Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find all the indexes where x is present in the input array. Save all the indexes in an array (in increasing order).
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

Input Format :
Line 1 : An Integer N i.e. size of array
Line 2 : N integers which are elements of the array, separated by spaces
Line 3 : Integer x

Output Format :
indexes where x is present in the array (separated by space)
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3
Sample Input :
5
9 8 10 8 8
8
Sample Output :
1 3 4

### Problems

5) Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the last index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
Last index means - if x is present multiple times in the array, return the index at which x comes last in the array.

Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

Input Format :
Line 1 : An Integer N i.e. size of array
Line 2 : N integers which are elements of the array, separated by spaces
Line 3 : Integer x

Output Format :
last index or -1
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3
Sample Input :
4
9 8 10 8
8
Sample Output :

### Problems

6. Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
Do this recursively.

Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)

Output Format :
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)

Constraints :
1 <= x <= 30
0 <= n <= 30

### Problems

7. Given the code to print number from 1 to n in increasing order recursively.

Input Format :
Integer n

Output Format :
Numbers from 1 to n (separated by space)

Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10000
Sample Input :
6
Sample Output :
1 2 3 4 5 6
